##  Task Description
The task involves analyzing the **Student Performance Dataset (`student-mat.csv`)** using Python.  

Key focus areas:
-  Data loading, exploration, and cleaning  
-  Handling duplicates and missing values  
-  Answering analysis questions  
-  Creating meaningful visualizations  

---

##  Analysis Questions Addressed
1. What is the **average final grade (G3)**?  
2. How many students scored **above 15 in G3**?  
3. What is the **correlation between study time and G3**?  
4. Which **gender has a higher average G3**?  

---

##  Visualizations
The following plots were created to support the analysis:
- Histogram of final grades (G3)  
- Scatter plot (Study time vs. G3)  
- Bar chart (Average G3 by gender)

##  Implementation Details
- As per **task constraints**, the entire code has been written in a **single Jupyter Notebook cell** (instead of multiple structured cells).  
- Inline **Markdown documentation** is provided inside the notebook code cells.  
- Since the analysis was in a trial-and-error phase, I compiled the **final working code** at the end of the document.  
- Kindly excuse this format, as it was **not mentioned in the instructions initially**.
