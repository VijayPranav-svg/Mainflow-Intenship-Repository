Data Analysis with Python – Task 1
 Overview
This repository contains my internship project submission for Data Analysis and Data Science – Task 1.

The task involves analyzing the Student Performance Dataset (student-mat.csv) using Python, focusing on:

Data loading, exploration, and cleaning

Handling duplicates and missing values

Answering analysis questions:

Average final grade (G3)

Number of students scoring above 15 in G3

Correlation between study time and G3

Gender with higher average G3

Data visualizations:
Histogram of final grades

Scatter plot (study time vs G3)

Bar chart (average G3 by gender)

According to the task constraints, the entire code has been written in a single Jupyter Notebook cell (instead of multiple structured cells).
This was done as per instructions in the provided task PDF.

Additionally, markdown documentation is Mentiond in the code cells  here since the analysis was still in a trial-and-error phase I have only provided the Total code in once cell at the end of the Document . I request you to kindly excuse this, as it was not mentioned in the beginning.
