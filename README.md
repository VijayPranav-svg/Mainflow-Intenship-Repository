##  Current Status
-  **Task 1 completed** successfully.  
-  **Task 2 in completed** – however, the dataset download link (Global Superstore / `sales_data.csv`) is missing from the provided PDF.
-  After raising the issue, I was instructed by the internship mentor to choose my own dataset from Google and proceed with the analysis.

Therefore, due to the lack of the official dataset and with permission from the mentor, I have downloaded a dataset from Google and used it for Task 2.
I Have Also Attached A Word File Regarding this Issue For You Clear Understanding
